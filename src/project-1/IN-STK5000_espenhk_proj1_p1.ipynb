    "Given a probability $p \\in [0,1]$ of our loan being paid back, we wish to find the expected return on investment. We'll use $a$ for the amount, $d$ for the duration of the loan, and $r=0.005$ as the monthly interest rate. Treating the \"win/lose\" (repaid/forfeited) value as a binomial random variable $X$ with $X=1$ for a repaid loan and $X=0$ for a forfeited one, we know the expected value is\n",
